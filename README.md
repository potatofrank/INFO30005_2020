**Login**
The current log in function requires a username and a password. There's currently no sign up funcion implemented, thus we only use an admin account to log in. The details of the admin account are hard coded inside the "login.js" file. To log in, enter the <br /> username: admin <br />
password: admin

**Homepage map**
A map of Melbourne with its main suburbs and cities can be seen on the homepage, the areas are accurately divided. When we move our cursor onto the names of those areas on the map, we can see a colour change on it, those names will turn into Cov-19 confirmed case number during later development, instead of a colour change.

**Data Filling**
If you successfully log in with our admin account details, you would be able to fill in relavant information of a patient who has been tested positive for Cov-19. The required fields of the information can be gender, age, symptom, confirmed date, etc. This is submitted by government officers and doctors. There's another section named "Add total Case Info" that can update total case amount, including death case, cured case, case increased on that day and accumulated case number in total. We can also delete cases by specifying the ID of the specific case submission.

**Notice**
Some of the wording of the information filling section would appear awkawrd and confusing, we're still figuring out the best field names and format, this will be improved during later development.
